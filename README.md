Predicting Titanic survival

based on parents aboard, siblings aboard, and place of embarkment

logregtitanic--logistic regression model
more preprocessing could improve model (e.g., encode age as child/adult/elderly; encode siblings as >0, >2, >4 since this is ordinal) 

decisiontree_titanic--decision tree model
less preprocessing is necessary
replaced NaN's in Age data with the mean age of all the others.
